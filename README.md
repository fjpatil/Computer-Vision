# Computer-Vision and Open CV Library Exploration  

In this repo I have created the different use cases like Car detection, Pedestrain detection, Face detection, Eyes detection.
Here I have used universal dataset "Haarcascades", so using Haarcascades dataset I am able to implement the above mentioned use cases.
